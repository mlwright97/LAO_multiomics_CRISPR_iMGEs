# CRISPR-iMGE pipeline
This pipeline has been developed to identify/predict CRISPRs and invasive mobile genetic elements (iMGEs) within multi-, meta-omics dataset of metagenomics and metatranscriptomics of a longitudinal dataset obtained from samples of foaming islets of activated sludge within a wastewater treatment plant. 

CRISPR-MGE pipeline identifies the CRISPRs from reads and contigs, and plasmids and phages from contigs. Then, CRISPR elements are assigned to metagenomic assembled genomes (MAGs) previously obtained from the dataset. Finally, iMGE-host networks are provided.
